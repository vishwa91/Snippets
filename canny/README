Canny edge detection using python and scipy
Author:			Vishwanath
Dependencies:	numpy, scipy, Python Image Library (optional)

Editing done : Prateek Garg. 

Command line usage is no longer necessary. Open the GUI module and type in the file name without
the extension (only .jpg files can be used for input).

Sobel code is also added.


If GUI does not work and user has to implement Canny through python shell, follow the original instructions given by Vishwanth:
*    This module will implement canny edge detection.
*    
*    Usage:
*    >>> from Canny import Canny
*    >>> canny = Canny('bike.jpg', sigma = 0.85)
*    >>> imout = canny.grad
*    >>> imout.show() # Use this only if Python Image Library is installed
*    
*    Note:
*    1. The code is not very fast
*    2. Improvements are welcome
